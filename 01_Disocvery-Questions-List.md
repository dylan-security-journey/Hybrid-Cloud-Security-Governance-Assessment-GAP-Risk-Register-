## üßæ Initial Observations (Consultant Notes)

- *Example:* CloudMed is migrating 60% of workloads to AWS but lacks unified IAM governance across hybrid environments.  
- *Example:* Policies are reviewed annually but not mapped to frameworks; compliance tracking is manual.  
- *Example:* Audit preparation consumes ~200 hours per quarter due to non-automated evidence collection.

## üß≠ Proposed Scope of Engagement

| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Framework Baseline** | NIST CSF & HIPAA (healthcare context) |
| **Systems in Scope** | AWS Cloud, On-Prem EHR Servers, Internal GRC Tool |
| **Focus Domains** | Governance, Risk, Compliance Automation, Awareness & Reporting |
| **Deliverables** | Gap Assessment Matrix, Risk Register, Executive Summary Report |
| **Timeline** | 2-Week Assessment Simulation |

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. Validate scope and stakeholder list.  
2. Collect sample control documentation, audit logs, and GRC tool exports (fictional/dummy data).  
3. Begin Gap Assessment mapping against NIST CSF and IBM Active Governance Services capabilities.  
4. Draft Risk Register aligned to high-impact findings.  
5. Prepare Executive Summary and recommendations.
