# üßæ Executive Summary ‚Äì Hybrid Cloud Security Governance Assessment  
**Client:** CloudMed Solutions (Fictional)  
**Consultant:** Dylan Nguyen (IBM SSRC Portfolio Simulation)  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Framework Baseline:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) + HIPAA + SOC 2  
**Reference Model:** IBM Active Governance Services (AGS)

---

## üéØ Project Overview
CloudMed Solutions, a mid-sized healthcare SaaS provider, engaged this simulated IBM SSRC assessment to evaluate its **hybrid cloud security posture** and **compliance readiness** as it continues migrating from on-premises EHR systems to AWS cloud infrastructure.  
The objective was to identify control gaps, assess governance maturity, and recommend automation-driven improvements aligned with **IBM Active Governance Services (AGS)** capabilities.

This assessment covered people, process, and technology domains with a focus on:
- **Governance and risk management**
- **Compliance automation and audit readiness**
- **Hybrid cloud visibility and reporting**
- **Cyber awareness and culture**

## üß© Key Findings

| Category | Observation | Business Impact |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Identity & Access Management** | Separate identity systems (Active Directory and AWS IAM) lack integration and consistent privilege governance. | Elevated risk of unauthorized access and audit findings. |
| **Compliance & Audit Processes** | Evidence collection and control testing are manual, consuming ~200 hours per quarter. | Operational inefficiency and delayed audit readiness. |
| **Risk Governance** | No formal risk committee or centralized risk register. | Limited enterprise visibility and fragmented accountability. |
| **Policy Management** | HIPAA policies exist but are not mapped to SOC 2 or version-controlled. | Overlapping compliance efforts and inconsistent control documentation. |
| **Monitoring & Detection** | No unified dashboard for hybrid cloud activity or compliance KPIs. | Delayed detection of deviations or vulnerabilities. |
| **People & Awareness** | Training limited to annual sessions; executives not involved in exercises. | Low resilience to emerging threats and regulatory changes. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Top Risks Identified

| Rank | Risk Description | Risk Score (L√óI) | Domain |
|------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | Inconsistent IAM governance across on-prem and AWS environments | **20 (High)** | Identity & Access |
| 2 | Manual audit and evidence collection processes | **16 (High)** | Compliance & Audit |
| 3 | Lack of formal risk governance and ownership | **15 (High)** | Governance & Risk |

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

1. **Implement a Centralized GRC Platform**  
   Deploy IBM OpenPages or Archer to automate evidence collection, control tracking, and risk reporting.  
   ‚Üí *Expected benefit:* Reduce audit preparation time by 40% and improve accountability.  

2. **Formalize Cyber Governance Structure**  
   Establish a Cyber Governance Committee to oversee policy updates, risk acceptance, and compliance alignment.  
   ‚Üí *Expected benefit:* Clear ownership and consistent risk visibility across business units.  

3. **Integrate IAM and Monitoring Tools**  
   Centralize user provisioning, MFA enforcement, and hybrid cloud activity monitoring.  
   ‚Üí *Expected benefit:* Strengthened access control and improved incident response visibility.  

4. **Develop Executive Dashboards and KPIs**  
   Leverage PowerBI or watsonx to visualize compliance telemetry and risk trends.  
   ‚Üí *Expected benefit:* Real-time insights for leadership decision-making.  

5. **Enhance Awareness and Simulation Training**  
   Launch role-based awareness programs and executive crisis simulations.  
   ‚Üí *Expected benefit:* Improved cyber culture and preparedness across the organization.

## üß† Business Value Summary
By addressing these priorities, CloudMed can transition from reactive compliance to a **proactive, automated governance model**.  
Implementing IBM AGS recommendations will:
- Increase audit efficiency and transparency  
- Strengthen regulatory alignment across HIPAA and SOC 2  
- Reduce risk exposure through integrated IAM and visibility  
- Foster a sustainable, security-aware culture across all levels  

This engagement positions CloudMed to achieve **optimized security maturity** (Level 5) and demonstrates how IBM‚Äôs hybrid cloud governance approach transforms compliance into a driver of business confidence.
